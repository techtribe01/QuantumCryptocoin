# Quantum Coin

Quantum Coin is a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer electronic cash system that leverages a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to ensure security, transparency, and resistance to censorship, representing a breakthrough in digital finance. With a fixed maximum supply of 100 million tokens and a predictable issuance schedule, Quantum Coin serves as both a store of value and a medium of exchange, combining the scarcity and durability of hard commodities with the convenience and portability of digital assets. The network operates without any central authority, allowing anyone to participate while maintaining strong network integrity, and its open-source protocol ensures that changes can only be made through majority consensus, making Quantum Coin a robust, global, and neutral digital monetary good.
